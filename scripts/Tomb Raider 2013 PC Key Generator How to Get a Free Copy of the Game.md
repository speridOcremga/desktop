If you want to play Tomb Raider 2013 on your PC, you might be looking for a way to get a free key for the game. There are many websites and videos that claim to offer key generators or serial codes for Tomb Raider 2013, but most of them are scams or malware. You should be careful not to download or run any suspicious files or programs that could harm your computer or steal your personal information.
 
One of the safest and easiest ways to get a free copy of Tomb Raider 2013 is to use the Humble Bundle website. Humble Bundle is a platform that sells bundles of games and other digital products at discounted prices, and lets you choose how much you want to pay and how to distribute your money between the creators, charities, and Humble Bundle itself. Sometimes, Humble Bundle offers free games for a limited time as part of their promotions.
 
In January 2018, Humble Bundle gave away free keys for Tomb Raider 2013 as part of their monthly subscription service. If you were a subscriber at that time, you could have claimed your key from your Humble Bundle account. However, if you missed that opportunity, you might still be able to find someone who has an extra key and is willing to share it with you.
 
One place where you can look for generous people who have spare keys for Tomb Raider 2013 is the Steam Community. Steam is a digital distribution platform that sells and manages games and other software. Steam also has a social network feature where users can create profiles, join groups, chat with friends, and participate in discussions. Some Steam users who have extra keys for Tomb Raider 2013 might post them on the Steam forums or give them away in random drawings or contests.
 
For example, in January 2018, a Steam user named Mr Pickle started a thread on the Tomb Raider General Discussions forum[^1^], where he posted a free key for the game and invited others to do the same. Many other users followed his example and shared their keys with other people who wanted to play the game. However, you should be aware that these keys are usually claimed very quickly by other users or bots, so you have to be fast and lucky to get one.
 
If you want to try your luck on the Steam Community, here are some tips to increase your chances of getting a free key for Tomb Raider 2013:
 
- Check the Tomb Raider General Discussions forum regularly for new posts that might contain free keys.
- Use the search function to look for keywords like "free", "key", "giveaway", or "generator".
- Be polite and respectful when asking for or thanking someone for a key.
- Do not beg or spam for keys.
- Do not fall for scams or phishing links that ask you to enter your personal information or download suspicious files.
- Do not use multiple accounts or bots to claim keys.
- Activate your key on Steam as soon as possible before it expires or gets revoked.

In conclusion, Tomb Raider 2013 is a great game that you can enjoy on your PC if you have a valid key for it. However, getting a free key is not easy and requires some luck and caution. The best way to get a free copy of Tomb Raider 2013 is to use Humble Bundle when they offer it as part of their promotions. Alternatively, you can try to find someone who has an extra key and is willing to share it with you on the Steam Community. However, you should be careful not to download or run any malicious files or programs that could harm your computer or steal your personal information.
