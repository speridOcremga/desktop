The Horse Soldiers is a 1959 American adventure war western film directed by John Ford and starring John Wayne, William Holden and Constance Towers. It is loosely based on a novel by Harold Sinclair, which in turn was inspired by a true story of Grierson's Raid during the American Civil War.
 
The movie follows Colonel John Marlowe (Wayne), a Union cavalry officer who leads his men on a daring mission behind Confederate lines to destroy a railroad and supply depot at Newton Station. Along the way, he has to deal with Major Henry Kendall (Holden), a surgeon who disagrees with his methods, and Hannah Hunter (Towers), a southern belle who overhears his plans and becomes his prisoner. The movie features several exciting battles, including a skirmish with boy cadets from a military school and a final showdown at a bridge that must be blown up to stop the enemy pursuit.
 
The Horse Soldiers is one of Ford's most underrated films, as it combines his trademark visual style, historical accuracy and human drama. It also showcases the chemistry between Wayne and Holden, two of the biggest stars of their time, who had never worked together before. The movie also has a memorable soundtrack, featuring the song When Johnny Comes Marching Home.

The movie is based on a real historical event known as Grierson's Raid, which was a daring Union cavalry operation that took place in April and May 1863. The raid was led by Colonel Benjamin Grierson, who had a similar background to John Wayne's character. Grierson was a former music teacher who disliked horses and had no military experience before the war. He proved to be a skilled and courageous leader who executed one of the most successful raids of the war.
 
Grierson's Raid had two main objectives: to distract the Confederate forces from Grant's main attack on Vicksburg, and to destroy the vital railroad and supply lines that supported the Confederate army in Mississippi. Grierson and his men rode from Tennessee to Louisiana, covering more than 600 miles in 16 days. They faced constant harassment from Confederate cavalry, militia and civilians, but they managed to elude or defeat them in several skirmishes. They also freed hundreds of slaves along the way, some of whom joined the raiders.
 
The raid had a significant impact on the outcome of the Vicksburg Campaign. It drew away thousands of Confederate troops from defending the city, and it disrupted the communication and transportation network that supplied them. It also boosted the morale of the Union soldiers and civilians, who admired Grierson's daring and skill. The raid was widely reported in the Northern press, and Grierson became a national hero. He was promoted to brigadier general and received praise from President Abraham Lincoln and General Grant.
 
The movie captures some of the key events and details of the raid, but it also takes some artistic liberties for dramatic effect. For example, the movie depicts a romance between Wayne's character and a southern belle, which did not happen in reality. The movie also shows a battle with boy cadets from a military school, which was based on a different incident that occurred in Virginia. The movie also changes some of the names and ranks of the characters, such as William Holden's character, who was actually a lieutenant colonel named Edward Hatch.
 
Despite these inaccuracies, the movie is still a faithful and entertaining representation of one of the most remarkable feats of the Civil War. It showcases the bravery, endurance and ingenuity of Grierson and his men, who accomplished their mission against overwhelming odds. It also portrays the horrors and hardships of war, as well as the human emotions and conflicts that arise from it. The movie is a tribute to the men who fought for their cause, whether they wore blue or gray.
